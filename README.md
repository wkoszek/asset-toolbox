# Asset Toolbox

This is a toolbox for iOS assets and not only.

The idea is that the spreadsheet in Google Docs hosts all the resolutions
advertised by Apple:

You can suggest a change, I'd review it, and regenerate the `.ods` file, use
`./parse_assets.rb` and update YAML and JSON files as well.

Then interested individuals can grab the files and script their workflows
around that.
